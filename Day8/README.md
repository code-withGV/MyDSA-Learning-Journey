# Day 8: Mastering Binary Search
Welcome to Day 8 of my DSA learning journey. Today, I focused on conceptual problems related to Binary Search and also solved some LeetCode problems to apply the concepts.

# Conceptual Problems
1. # Ceiling of a Number
The ceiling of a number in a sorted array is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to the given number. This problem helps in understanding the upper bound search in Binary Search.

2. # Floor of a Number
The floor of a number in a sorted array is the largest element in the array smaller than or equal to the given number. This problem helps in understanding the lower bound search in Binary Search.

# LeetCode Problems
1. # Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target
Problem: Given a list of sorted characters letters and a target character target, return the smallest character in the list that is larger than the given target.
2. # Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
Problem: Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value. If the target is not found, return [-1, -1].
