# Day 10 - DSA Learning Journey
##### Welcome to Day 10 of my DSA learning journey! Today, I focused on the concept of searching in rotated arrays, which is essential for coding interviews and competitive programming. Below are the topics I covered and the problems I solved.

# Concepts Covered
# 1. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
In a rotated sorted array, the array is initially sorted, but then some leading elements are shifted to the end. This creates a scenario where we need to modify the binary search to handle the rotation.

# 2. Search in Rotated Sorted Array with Duplicate Values
This problem introduces the complexity of handling duplicate values in a rotated array, which requires additional checks during the binary search process.

# 3. Rotation Count
Determining the number of rotations in a sorted array helps in understanding how the array has been altered. This can be solved using modifications of the binary search algorithm.
