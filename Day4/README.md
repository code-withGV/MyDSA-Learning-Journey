5. **Product of Two Numbers**
   - Defined a method that returns the product of two numbers entered by user.
**Prime Check**
   - Defined a method to find out if a number is prime or not.

6. **Grade Display**
   - Wrote a program that will ask the user to enter his/her marks (out of 100). Defined a method that will display grades according to the marks entered:
     ```

     91-100       AA
     81-90        AB

     61-70        BC
     51-60        CD
     41-50        DD
     <=40        Fail
     ```
7. **Pythagorean Triplet Check**
    - Wrote a function to check if a given triplet is a Pythagorean triplet or not.
