Day 5: Array Manipulations
Today, I focused on solving problems related to array manipulations. These problems are fundamental in understanding how arrays work and how to efficiently manipulate data stored in arrays.

Problems Solved:
Swap the elements of an array
Find the maximum element in an array
Find the maximum element in an array for a given range
Reverse an array

Learning Outcomes:
Improved understanding of array indexing and traversal.
Enhanced skills in writing and optimizing loops.
Developed techniques for efficient data manipulation within arrays.
