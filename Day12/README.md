# Day 12: Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort and Selection Sort
### Overview
Today, I focused on understanding and implementing two fundamental sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. Here's a brief overview of what I learned and implemented.

### Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm where each pair of adjacent elements is compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.
#### Time Complexity
1. Best Case: O(n)
2. Worst Case: O(n^2)Matrix

### Selection Sort
Selection Sort divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the order) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

#### Time Complexity
1. Best and Worst Case: O(n^2)

## Conclusion
Understanding these sorting algorithms is essential for grasping more complex sorting techniques and improving problem-solving skills.
