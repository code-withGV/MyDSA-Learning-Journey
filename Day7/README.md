Day 7: Binary Search
Today, I explored the Binary Search algorithm and its applications. Below are the key points and the code implementations for both ascending and descending arrays.

Topics Covered
Binary Search Algorithm:

An efficient way to search for an element in a sorted array.
Divides the array into halves to reduce the search space.
Time Complexity:

Binary Search: O(log n)
Linear Search: O(n)
Why Binary Search is more efficient for large datasets.
Agnostic Binary Search:

Implementing a search that works for both ascending and descending sorted arrays.
