# Day 11: Binary Search in 2D Arrays
### Overview
Today, I focused on understanding and implementing Binary Search in 2D arrays. This included solving problems related to searching in row-column matrices and strictly sorted matrices. Although challenging, these problems are crucial for mastering efficient search algorithms.

### Problems Solved
Searching in Row-Col Matrix
Search in Strictly Sorted Matrix
Details
#### Problem 1: Searching in Row-Col Matrix
Description: Implement a function to search for a target value in a matrix where each row and each column is sorted in ascending order.
Approach: Use a combination of binary search and matrix traversal to efficiently locate the target value.
#### Problem 2: Search in Strictly Sorted Matrix
Description: Solve for a target value in a matrix where the entire matrix is sorted in ascending order.
Approach: Adapt binary search to work within the constraints of a strictly sorted 2D matrix.
### Key Learnings
1. Enhanced my understanding of binary search algorithms.
2. Developed efficient strategies for searching in complex data structures.
3. Gained experience in problem-solving and algorithm optimization.
