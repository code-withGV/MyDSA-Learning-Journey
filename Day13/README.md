# Day 13: Insertion Sort and Cyclic Sorts

## Overview
Today, I focused on understanding and implementing insertion sort and cyclic sorts. I also solved several problems on LeetCode that reinforced these concepts.

## Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is particularly useful for small datasets and nearly sorted arrays. It works by building a sorted array one element at a time.

## Cyclic Sort
Cyclic sort is effective for problems involving arrays with elements in a certain range. Identifying patterns in cyclic sort problems is crucial for efficient problem-solving.

## Problems Solved

### Missing Number
**Description:** Find the missing number in an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n.  

### Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array
**Description:** Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in an array.  

### Find the Duplicate Number
**Description:** Given an array of integers, find the duplicate number.  


### Find All Duplicates in an Array
**Description:** Find all duplicates in an array of integers.  

## Key Learnings
- Insertion Sort is efficient for small and nearly sorted arrays.
- Cyclic Sort problems often follow a common pattern, making it essential to recognize these patterns for effective solutions.
